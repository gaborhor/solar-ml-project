# solar-ml-project

This solo project was created with the intent of engineering non-lag time-based data features and identifying "secondary" solar and atmospheric data features meaningful in ML modeling of photovoltaic cell outputs.

From there, I intend to reconstruct missing elements of the data, as well as attempt ARIMA-based modeling.
Unfortunately, Forecasting is likely a non-starter with the existing models I created, as they take weather conditions as input, and weather itself can only be forecast in relatively short terms.

Still, data imputation and interpolation opportunities remain available, and are an ongoing process in this project, acknowledged a the end of the .ipynb
